# The purpose of this code is to determine a total factor productivity time series based on 
# the following information:
#
# <gdp? a time series of gdp
# <pop> a time series of population
# 
# <params> a dictionary of parameters
# <params[deelta]> depreciation rate
# <alpha> elasticity of output with respect to capital
# 
#  We have as our core equation:
# 
#  Y(t) = A(t) K(t)**alpha  L(t)**(1-alpha)
#
#  d K(t) / d t = s * Y(t) - delta * K(t)
#
# where Y(t) is gross production, A(t) is total factor productivity, K(t) is capital, and
#  L(t) is population.
#
# In dimension units:
#
# Y(t) -- $/yr
# K(t) -- $
# L(t) -- people
# A(t) -- ($/yr) ($)**(-alpha) * (people)**(alpha-1)
#
# Howeever, this can be non-dimensionalized by dividing each year's value by the value at the first
# year, for example:
#
#  y(t) = Y(t)/Y(0)   where 0 is a stand-in for the reference year
#  k(t) = K(t)/K(0)
#  l(t) = L(t)/L(0)
#  a(t) - A(t)/A(0)
#
#  This makes it so that all of the year(0) values are known.

    """
    Calculate total factor productivity time series using the Solow-Swan growth model.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    gdp : array-like
        Time series of gross domestic product (Y) in $/yr
    pop : array-like  
        Time series of population (L) in people
    params : dict
        Model parameters containing:
        - 's': savings rate (dimensionless)
        - 'alpha': elasticity of output with respect to capital (dimensionless)
        - 'delta': depreciation rate in 1/yr
        
    Returns
    -------
    a : numpy.ndarray
        Total factor productivity time series, normalized to year 0 (A(t)/A(0))
    k : numpy.ndarray
        Capital stock time series, normalized to year 0 (K(t)/K(0))
        
    Notes
    -----
    Assumes system is in steady-state at year 0 with normalized values of 1.
    Uses discrete time integration with 1-year time steps.
