# Claude Code Style Guide for COIN_SSP

## Coding Philosophy
This project prioritizes **elegant, fail-fast code** that surfaces errors quickly rather than hiding them.

## Code Style Preferences

### Error Handling
- **No input validation** on function parameters (except for command-line interfaces)
- **No defensive programming** - let exceptions bubble up naturally
- **Fail fast** - prefer code that crashes immediately on invalid inputs rather than continuing with bad data
- **No try-catch blocks** unless absolutely necessary for program logic (not error suppression)
- **Assume complete data** - do not check for missing data fields (e.g., precipitation). If required data is missing, let the code fail with natural Python errors rather than handling gracefully

### Code Elegance
- **Minimize conditional statements** - prefer functional approaches, mathematical expressions, and numpy vectorization
- **Favor mathematical clarity** over defensive checks
- **Use numpy operations** instead of loops and conditionals where possible
- **Prefer concise, readable expressions** over verbose defensive code
- **Compute once, use many times** - move invariant calculations outside loops and create centralized helper functions
- **Centralize repeated logic** - extract common operations into utility functions to prevent bugs and inconsistencies

### Function Design
- Functions should assume valid inputs and focus on their core mathematical/logical purpose
- Let Python's natural error messages guide debugging rather than custom error handling
- Prioritize algorithmic clarity over robustness checking

## Examples

### Preferred Style
```python
def calculate_growth_rate(values):
    return values[1:] / values[:-1] - 1

def apply_damage_function(output, temperature, sensitivity):
    return output * np.exp(-sensitivity * temperature**2)
```

### Avoid
```python
def calculate_growth_rate(values):
    if not isinstance(values, np.ndarray):
        raise TypeError("values must be numpy array")
    if len(values) < 2:
        raise ValueError("need at least 2 values")
    try:
        return values[1:] / values[:-1] - 1
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Growth calculation failed: {e}")
        return None
```

## Project Context
This is a climate economics modeling project implementing the Solow-Swan growth model for gridded climate impact assessment. Code should reflect the mathematical elegance of economic models while maintaining computational efficiency for grid-scale analysis.

### Module Organization
- **`coin_ssp_core.py`**: Core economic model functions and parameter classes
- **`coin_ssp_utils.py`**: Consolidated utility functions for mathematical operations, visualization, time series processing, NetCDF data processing, and target GDP reduction calculations
- **`calculate_target_gdp_reductions.py`**: Standalone tool for spatially-explicit target GDP reduction calculations (refactored to use utilities)
- **`main.py`**: Country-level workflow orchestration
- **`main_integrated.py`**: Integrated grid-cell processing pipeline implementing the complete 5-step workflow

Keep helper functions organized in utils to maintain clean separation of concerns. The utilities module now consolidates mathematical/visualization functions, NetCDF data processing functions, and target GDP reduction functions to maximize code reuse between standalone and integrated workflows.

### Time Series Processing
- **LOESS Filtering**: Use locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) for separating climate trends from weather variability
- **Trend Preservation**: Maintain long-term climate trends while filtering out interannual variability after reference year (2025)

## Data Processing Philosophy
- **Interpolation over Extrapolation**: Use linear interpolation between known data points rather than extrapolating beyond available data
- **Annual Resolution**: Process all time series at annual resolution for consistency between climate and economic data
- **Country Completeness**: Include countries only when they have complete time series data across all required variables
- **Quality Assurance**: Preserve exact values at original data points when interpolating (e.g., 5-year economic data points)

## Mathematical Robustness
- **Handle Edge Cases Mathematically**: Use `np.maximum(0, value)` to prevent negative capital stock rather than conditional checks
- **L-BFGS-B Optimization**: Prefer gradient-based optimization with proper bounds for parameter calibration
- **Direct Parameter Scaling**: Use `param = scale * base_value` rather than multiplicative scaling to avoid zero-multiplication issues

### NetCDF Data Handling
- **xarray Integration**: Use xarray for elegant NetCDF operations and coordinate handling
- **Vectorized Operations**: Apply economic calculations across entire spatial grids simultaneously
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process large gridded datasets using chunking and lazy evaluation where appropriate
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintain proper coordinate systems, units, and attributes in output files
- **Unit Conversion**: Convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius using physical constant 273.15
- **Area Weighting**: Use cosine of latitude for proper global mean calculations
- **Consolidated Utilities**: Keep all NetCDF processing functions in `coin_ssp_utils.py` to avoid duplication
- **Repository Storage**: Small NetCDF files can be stored in git with appropriate .gitignore patterns

## Output and Data Management Philosophy

### Step-by-Step Output Strategy
The integrated processing pipeline writes output after each step completion for several important reasons:

#### Implementation Policy
- **Write after each step**: Output files are created immediately after each processing step completes
- **Memory management**: Large gridded arrays are written to disk to free memory for subsequent steps
- **Data persistence**: Protects against losing computation if later steps fail
- **Debugging capability**: Intermediate results can be examined for validation and troubleshooting
- **Progress tracking**: Users can monitor incremental progress on long-running processing jobs

#### File Naming Convention
```
output_integrated_{model_name}_{timestamp}/
├── step1_target_gdp_{model_name}_{reference_ssp}.nc
├── step2_baseline_tfp_{model_name}.nc  
├── step3_scaling_factors_{model_name}_{reference_ssp}.nc
├── step4_forward_results_{model_name}.nc
└── step5_final_output_{model_name}.nc
```

#### Output Format Strategy
- **Step 1 (Target GDP)**: NetCDF files with spatial target reduction patterns, coordinate systems, and constraint verification metadata
- **Step 2 (Baseline TFP)**: NetCDF files containing TFP and capital stock time series for all SSP scenarios with proper coordinate information
- **Step 3 (Scaling Factors)**: Enhanced NetCDF files with 5D scaled parameter arrays `[lat, lon, damage_func, target, param]` containing both scaling factors and all 12 scaled damage function parameters (scaling_factor × base_parameter)
- **Steps 4-5**: NetCDF format for gridded results with comprehensive metadata
- **Visualization**: Target GDP reductions include existing PDF map generation; TFP and scaling factor results focus on NetCDF data storage (visualization can be added later as needed)

#### Technical Implementation
- **Centralized utilities**: Output functions consolidated in `coin_ssp_utils.py` following hybrid architecture pattern
- **Metadata preservation**: Full coordinate systems, global attributes, and processing history maintained
- **Directory management**: Timestamped output directories prevent overwriting and provide processing history
- **Error resilience**: Each step's output persists independently for debugging and resumability

## Lessons Learned: Constraint System Design

### Target GDP Reduction Implementation
The implementation of spatially-explicit target reduction functions revealed important lessons about constraint system design in climate economics:

#### Mathematical vs. Physical Consistency
- **Issue**: Constraint systems can be mathematically correct but produce physically unrealistic results
- **Example**: Linear temperature-damage function showing backwards relationship (more damage at colder temperatures)
- **Root Cause**: GDP-weighted constraints combined with spatial temperature patterns can create counterintuitive solutions
- **Solution**: Always verify that mathematical solutions align with physical/economic expectations

#### Debugging Complex Algorithms
- **Document Mathematical Basis**: Extensive comments showing constraint equations, solution methods, and expected behavior
- **Add Debug Output**: Print intermediate calculations (coefficients, constraint values) to verify algorithm correctness  
- **Spatial Diagnosis**: Create diagnostic tools to examine spatial patterns and validate temperature-damage relationships
- **Point-wise Verification**: Test specific temperature points to confirm constraint satisfaction

#### Temperature Dependency in Climate Damage
- **Physical Expectation**: Climate damage should generally increase with temperature
- **Constraint Design**: Ensure constraint systems enforce realistic temperature dependencies
- **Spatial Considerations**: Account for how GDP distribution across temperature gradients affects global constraints
- **Alternative Approaches**: Consider reformulating constraints to use cold-temperature reference points with zero damage

#### Economic Realism vs Mathematical Precision
- **Issue**: Mathematically precise constraint satisfaction can produce economically meaningless results
- **Example**: Quadratic damage function yielding >100% GDP losses (>252% in polar regions)
- **Insight**: Economic bounds are as important as mathematical constraints in climate damage modeling
- **Solution**: Implement realistic bounds (e.g., maximum 80% GDP loss) alongside mathematical precision

#### Function Form Selection
- **Unconstrained quadratics**: Can produce extreme values in temperature ranges outside calibration data
- **Bounded alternatives**: Consider sigmoid functions, piecewise linear, or constrained optimization with bounds
- **Trade-offs**: Balance mathematical tractability with economic plausibility across full spatial temperature range

These lessons emphasize the importance of validating not just mathematical correctness but also physical realism and economic plausibility in climate-economic modeling algorithms.

## Current Implementation Status: Integrated Processing Pipeline

### Standard Processing Loop Hierarchy

Consistent loop structure established for all 5 processing steps:

```python
# STANDARD LOOP HIERARCHY (outermost to innermost):
for ssp_scenario in ssp_scenarios:           # 1. SSP scenario (when multiple)
    for target_reduction in target_reductions:   # 2. Target GDP reduction  
        for damage_function in damage_functions:     # 3. Damage function
            for lat_idx in range(nlat):                  # 4. Latitude
                for lon_idx in range(nlon):                  # 5. Longitude  
                    for time_idx in range(ntime):               # 6. Time (when needed)
                        # Core computation here
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **SSP Outermost**: Minimizes NetCDF file loading, processes one scenario at a time
- **Parameter Grouping**: Target reductions and damage functions form logical processing units
- **Spatial Independence**: Grid cells can be processed independently (parallelization ready)
- **Time Innermost**: Optimizes memory locality for time series operations
- **Consistency**: Same structure across steps reduces complexity and debugging effort

**Step-Specific Loop Adaptations:**
- **Step 1**: `target_reduction` only (single reference SSP, no time loop)
- **Step 2**: `ssp_scenario → spatial` (time handled within TFP calculation functions)
- **Step 3**: `target_reduction → damage_function → spatial` (single reference SSP)
- **Step 4**: Complete hierarchy for full multi-dimensional processing
- **Step 5**: Results processing following same organizational structure

### Grid Cell Validation and Handling

**Ocean and Ice Grid Cell Treatment:**
Grid cells with zero GDP or zero population represent ocean or ice regions and should be excluded from economic calculations:

```python
def is_valid_economic_grid_cell(gdp_value, population_value):
    """
    Determine if a grid cell should participate in economic calculations.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    gdp_value : float
        GDP value for the grid cell
    population_value : float  
        Population value for the grid cell
        
    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if grid cell should be processed, False if ocean/ice
    """
    return gdp_value > 0 and population_value > 0

# Usage in processing loops:
for lat_idx in range(nlat):
    for lon_idx in range(nlon):
        gdp_cell = gdp_data[lat_idx, lon_idx]
        pop_cell = population_data[lat_idx, lon_idx]
        
        if not is_valid_economic_grid_cell(gdp_cell, pop_cell):
            # Ocean/ice cell - fill with appropriate zero values
            if return_type == "scalar":
                result[lat_idx, lon_idx] = 0.0
            elif return_type == "vector":
                result[lat_idx, lon_idx, :] = np.zeros(vector_length)
            elif return_type == "array":
                result[lat_idx, lon_idx, :, :] = np.zeros((dim1, dim2))
            continue
            
        # Process valid economic grid cell
        # ... economic calculations here ...
```

**Zero Value Requirements:**
- **Scalar Results**: Set `result[lat_idx, lon_idx] = 0.0`
- **Vector Results**: Set `result[lat_idx, lon_idx, :] = np.zeros(vector_length)`
- **Array Results**: Set `result[lat_idx, lon_idx, :, :] = np.zeros(array_shape)`
- **Consistent Dimensions**: Ensure zero-filled results maintain same shape as valid calculations
- **No Computation**: Skip all economic calculations for ocean/ice cells to avoid division by zero and improve efficiency

**Implementation Across Steps:**
- **Step 1**: Ocean/ice cells get zero target GDP reductions (no economic activity to reduce)
- **Step 2**: Ocean/ice cells get zero TFP time series (no economic baseline)
- **Step 3**: Ocean/ice cells get zero scaling factors (no optimization needed)
- **Step 4**: Ocean/ice cells get zero forward model results (no economic projections)
- **Step 5**: Ocean/ice cells properly marked in NetCDF output with zero values and appropriate metadata
